\paragraph{Abstract} 
% In todayâ€™s digital landscape, the advent of online platforms has fundamentally transformed how people connect, communicate, and share information, allowing individuals to form communities and provide support across vast distances. 
% Reddit, in particular, plays a crucial role for those seeking emotional support, especially in sensitive areas like domestic and sexual violence. 
% While many survivors share their violence-related experiences on these subreddits, there's a notable gap in understanding what makes certain stories resonate with the community and gain attention, thus attracting more emotional support.
% This research identifies the linguistic and content-based aspects that contribute to a Reddit story gaining traction. 
% We shed light on the patterns and themes that connect with readers, causing them to provide more emotional support in the form of comments. 
% Ultimately, this understanding can help those who share their violence stories \ms{should we quantify this next part, if it seems too vague?} find the validation and comfort they seek.
% \ms{Mansi to add some preliminary results}

Social media provides a venue for people to receive emotional support, especially in sensitive areas like domestic and sexual violence. 
The anonymity and ease of access that social media offers can make it a natural option for victims of violence who might not be able to communicate as freely about their situation in the physical world. 
We consider selected moderated forums called subreddits on the leading social media site, Reddit, where many survivors share their experiences of violence. 
We observe that survivor stories show large differences in the attention and emotional support they attract from the community. 
We investigate survivor stories with regard to their structure and content to understand what attributes of a story positively or negatively influence the attention and support it attracts. 
Some examples of structure are length of the post, presence of passive voice phrases, pronouns, articles and special characters, while some examples of content features include emotions and sentiments expressed, relationship between the victim and perpetrator, age and gender of the victim and so on.  
Such understanding can help survivors and those who wish to help them through improved posting guidelines and tooling.
