% Guide for Authors: 

% Graphical abstract
% You are encouraged to provide a graphical abstract at submission.

% The graphical abstract should summarize the contents of your article in a concise, pictorial form which is designed to capture the attention of a wide readership. A graphical abstract will help draw more attention to your online article and support readers in digesting your research. Some guidelines:

% Submit your graphical abstract as a separate file in the online submission system.

% Ensure the image is a minimum of 531 x 1328 pixels (h x w) or proportionally more and is readable at a size of 5 x 13 cm using a regular screen resolution of 96 dpi.

% Our preferred file types for graphical abstracts are TIFF, EPS, PDF or MS Office files.

% We encourage you to view example graphical abstracts and read about the benefits of including them.

%%Research highlights
\begin{highlights}
\item Research highlight 1
\item Research highlight 2
\end{highlights}

% Guide for Authors:

% You are required to provide article highlights at submission.

% Highlights are a short collection of bullet points that should capture the novel results of your research as well as any new methods used during your study. Highlights will help increase the discoverability of your article via search engines. Some guidelines:

% Submit highlights as a separate editable file in the online submission system with the word "highlights" included in the file name.

% Highlights should consist of 3 to 5 bullet points, each a maximum of 85 characters, including spaces.

% We encourage you to view example article highlights and read about the benefits of their inclusion.

%% Keywords

%% Add \usepackage{lineno} before \begin{document} and uncomment 
%% following line to enable line numbers
% \linenumbers

%% main text
%%

%% Use \section commands to start a section
\section{Introduction}
%% Labels are used to cross-reference an item using \ref command.

% The introduction should clearly state the objectives of your work. We recommend that you provide an adequate background to your work but avoid writing a detailed literature overview or summary of your results.

\section{Material and methods}

% The materials and methods section should provide sufficient details about your materials and methods to allow your work to be reproduced by an independent researcher. Some guidelines:

% If the method you used has already been published, provide a summary and reference the originally published method.

% If you are quoting directly from a previously published method, use quotation marks and cite the source.

% Describe any modifications that you have made to existing methods.

% %% Use \subsubsection, \paragraph, \subparagraph commands to 
% %% start 3rd, 4th and 5th level sections.
% %% Refer following link for more details.
% %% https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Document_Structure#Sectioning_commands

\section{Theory and calculation}

% The theory section should lay the foundation for further work by extending the background you provided in the introduction to your article. The calculation section should represent a practical development from a theoretical basis.

\section{Results}
% Results should be clear and concise. We advise you to read the sections in this guide on supplying tables, artwork, supplementary material and sharing research data.

\section{Discussion}
% The discussion section should explore the significance of your results but not repeat them. You may combine your results and discussion sections into one section, if appropriate. We recommend that you avoid the use of extensive citations and discussion of published literature in the discussion section.

\section{Conclusion}
% The conclusion section should present the main conclusions of your study. You may have a stand-alone conclusions section or include your conclusions in a subsection of your discussion or results and discussion section.

\section{Glossary}
% Please provide definitions of field-specific terms used in your article, in a separate list.

\section{Abbreviations}
% Abbreviations which are not standard in the field should be defined in a footnote on the first page of your article.

% Abbreviations which are essential to include in your abstract should be defined at first mention in your abstract, as well as in a footnote on the first page of your article.

% Before submission we recommend that you review your use of abbreviations throughout your article to ensure that it is consistent.

% \subsubsection{Mathematics}
% %% Inline mathematics is tagged between $ symbols.
% This is an example for the symbol $\alpha$ tagged as inline mathematics.

% %% Displayed equations can be tagged using various environments. 
% %% Single line equations can be tagged using the equation environment.
% \begin{equation}
% f(x) = (x+a)(x+b)
% \end{equation}

% %% Unnumbered equations are tagged using starred versions of the environment.
% %% amsmath package needs to be loaded for the starred version of equation environment.
% \begin{equation*}
% f(x) = (x+a)(x+b)
% \end{equation*}

% %% align or eqnarray environments can be used for multi line equations.
% %% & is used to mark alignment points in equations.
% %% \\ is used to end a row in a multiline equation.
% \begin{align}
%  f(x) &= (x+a)(x+b) \\
%       &= x^2 + (a+b)x + ab
% \end{align}

% \begin{eqnarray}
%  f(x) &=& (x+a)(x+b) \nonumber\\ %% If equation numbering is not needed for a row use \nonumber.
%       &=& x^2 + (a+b)x + ab
% \end{eqnarray}

% %% Unnumbered versions of align and eqnarray
% \begin{align*}
%  f(x) &= (x+a)(x+b) \\
%       &= x^2 + (a+b)x + ab
% \end{align*}
